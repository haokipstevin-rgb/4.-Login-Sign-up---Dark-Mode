✨ Create Account Page (HTML + CSS)

This is a modern sign-up page UI I made using only HTML and CSS.
The design is inspired by a Dribbble layout, with a clean and minimal purple theme.


💡 What I Built

A two-part layout:

Left side with an image and quote

Right side with the sign-up form

Smooth double background for a soft, glowing look

Glass effect card using backdrop-filter

Google and Apple sign-up buttons

Simple and clean typography]

🧰 Tools Used

CSS3

🚀 How to Try It

Just open index.html in your browser.

Edit the text or image to make it your own.

You can also adjust colors or shadows inside style.css.
